</h1>


```
yarn add sheety
```


## Usage

Sheety works with any framework, but this example uses React.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import css from 'sheety';

const className = css`
  font-size: 6em;
  color: #333;
  text-align: center;
`;

const Title = props => {
  return (
    <h1 className={className}>sheety example ðŸ’©</h1>
  )
};

export default Title;

```

## Credit

`sheety` was bootstrapped following Kyle Hohenberger's article [Writing A CSS-in-JS Library From Scratch](https://medium.com/@tkh44/writing-a-css-in-js-library-from-scratch-96cd23a017b4). It's definitely an interesting exercise for anyone who is interested in CSS-in-JS and wants to learn more.
